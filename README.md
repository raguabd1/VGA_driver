A VGA display with a resolution of 1024x768 was successfully interfaced and tested using the ZedBoard through Vivado's IP Integrator (Block Design). The design was driven by a 148.5 MHz pixel clock, as required by the standard VGA timing for 1024x768 @ 148.5 Hz. The main clock was used to generate precise timing signals for sync pulses, front porch, and back porch intervals, which were accurately modeled and implemented in the design. Proper clock constraints were defined in the Vivado project to ensure timing correctness during synthesis and implementation. Upon hardware testing, the VGA monitor displayed the intended color pattern, confirming the correct functionality of the video interface.
